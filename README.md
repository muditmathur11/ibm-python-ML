In this project, I built a classifier to predict whether a loan case will be paid off or not.

I loaded a historical dataset from previous loan applications, clean the data, and apply different classification algorithms on the data. 

Algorithms that I used to build my models included:

*k-Nearest Neighbour
*Decision Tree
*Support Vector Machine
*Logistic Regression

The results were reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable:

*Jaccard index
*F1-score
*LogLoass
